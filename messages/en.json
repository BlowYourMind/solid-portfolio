    "hero_title": "About me",
    "hero_brief_desc": "Hey there! I'm a 22-year-old frontend developer with 3 years of experience in web development. I've also dipped my toes into backend work. I enjoy building clean, functional interfaces that look great and work even better. Always staying up-to-date with the latest UI/UX trends to create better user experiences. In my free time, I'm really into crypto :)",

    "life_path": "My life path",
    "life_path_desc_1": "I was born in Jelgava, Latvia, and spent my childhood full of energy and curiosity. I tried many sports including judo, football, volleyball, and track and field. But everything changed in the second grade when I discovered swimming. From that moment, I dedicated the next 12 years to the sport. I became a Master of Sports, a national junior champion, and represented Latvia in international competitions. Eventually, I achieved my goals and decided to step away from professional sports.  ",
    "life_path_desc_2": "Alongside sports, I was always fascinated by gaming and technology. I played cooperative and multiplayer games with friends, with CS:GO being my favorite. That interest led me to my first experience with programming. I used to host Minecraft servers, install mods, and manage everything myself, without even realizing I was learning valuable skills.  ",
    "life_path_desc_3": "During the COVID lockdown, I could no longer train in the pool. That was a difficult time, and I decided to focus on something new. I took a free Python course on Stepik, but couldnâ€™t find freelance work in that field. So I explored frontend development. I loved seeing live progress and improving user experiences. After a few months of learning through tutorials, a friend offered me a freelance project. I worked on a single-page application written in plain JavaScript, and that experience helped me grow as a frontend developer.  ",
    "life_path_desc_4": "Later, I joined SIA Softrocket as a frontend developer, working on large-scale projects in the iGaming industry. Each project generated over a million euros in monthly revenue. After some time, I sought a better work environment and transitioned to the e-commerce field. Today, I work as a lead frontend developer at BuySellVouchers.com, continuing to grow and build impactful products."
